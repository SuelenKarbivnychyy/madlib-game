    <p>
        I am so excited for Christmas this year! 
        I've been doing a lot of {{verb1}}ing to prepare!

        I have already picked out presents for everyone. I got {{person1}} a {{noun1}} and {{person2}} a {{noun2}}. I wrapped their presents in {{noun3}} and hid it them in the {% for house_room in room %} {{house_room}} and {% endfor %} so they wouldn't find them.
        {{person3}} and I made {{food}} for everyone to enjoy. They smell {{adjective1}}! I can't wait to eat them!

        We picked out the perfect tree. It is {{adjective2}}, and {{adjective3}} and smells like {{scent}}. It is my job to {{verb2}} the tree every day.

        I've been hoping for a {{noun4}} under the christmas tree this year. I really don't want to get a {{noun5}} this year!
        {{person4}} tells me that I need to go to bed early on christmas 
        eve so Santa can come. He's going to drive his {{transport}} with his {{animal}}s and land on our roof.

        I hope everyone has a {{adjective4}} Christmas!
    </p>
